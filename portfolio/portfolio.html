                <p class="">Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow
                    going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be
                    about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common
                    writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build
                    upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The
                    third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter
                    which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the
                    paragraph into their writing.

                        about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three
                        common
                        writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and
                        build
                        upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they
                        create. The
                        third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No
                        matter
                        which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to
                        incorporate the
                        paragraph into their writing.
